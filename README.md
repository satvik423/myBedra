## Introduction

Hi all, this is my BCA final year project named **MyBedra**. It's a comprehensive Flutter app designed to provide essential town information at your fingertips. Whether you need the contact details of a local doctor, plumber, electrician, lawyer, or auto driver, or you want to check bus timings, order groceries, or food from restaurants, MyBedra has got you covered.

## Features

- **Local Directory**: Find phone numbers of doctors, plumbers, electricians, lawyers, and more.
- **Transport Information**: Get contact information for auto drivers and view bus timings.
- **Order Services**: Order groceries and food from local restaurants directly through the app.
